  About Me
</h1>
For most of my career, I have been an electronics technician. It wasn't until I started working with the development team where I gain exposure to software developers and decided I wanted to make a change. I enrolled at Southern New Hampshire University to pursue a Bachelor's of Computer Science to become a software engineer. Most of the program focused on Java and Python with a little bit of C/C++ here and there but I've grown to favor C++. I am finishing up my final term and this ePortfolio was developed during my capstone class as my final project.
